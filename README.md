The **AI PDF Accessibility Remediation Application** brings **PDF Accessibility Remediation for WCAG & PDF/UA Compliance** directly into your October CMS backend. It is both a **PDF Accessibility Checker** and an **AI Remediation Tool**: upload documents or crawl your website for them, let AI repair the accessibility barriers automatically, review every check that was applied, and download conformant files — without leaving your CMS.

It fixes the barriers that make PDFs unusable with assistive technology: missing tags, incorrect reading order, inaccessible forms and tables, images without alternate text, and absent document structure, language and metadata.

It supports compliance with **WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, PDF/UA, ADA, Section 508, AODA, and EN 301 549 (EAA)**. With plain-language explanations and before/after examples for every check, even non-technical users can understand what was fixed and why it mattered.

This plugin is designed for:

- Businesses of all sizes
- Enterprises
- Government and public sector entities
- Website owners
- E-commerce platforms
- Development and maintenance agencies

## Why AI PDF Accessibility Remediation?

PDFs are where accessibility compliance quietly fails. A site can pass every
page-level audit and still publish hundreds of untagged documents — reports,
forms, invoices, policies — that screen readers cannot navigate at all.

Remediating them by hand is slow and expensive. This plugin makes it a routine
part of publishing: documents are discovered, repaired and re-checked inside the
CMS your team already uses, so accessible PDFs become the default rather than a
project.

## Key Features

- **AI PDF Remediation** – Automated repair of tags, reading order, alt text, headings, tables and metadata.
- **PDF Accessibility Checker** – Every check reported individually, expandable to a plain-language explanation and a before/after example.
- **Upload or Crawl** – Add files by drag and drop, add a PDF by URL, or sweep your website for every linked PDF.
- **Free Trial** – The free plan covers your first 5 pages; paid plans scale from 50 to 10,000 pages.
- **Bulk Remediation** – Select any number of documents and process them in one run, with live progress.
- **Deep Tag Scan** – Post-remediation verification against the document's tag tree, not just its declared metadata.
- **Authenticated Downloads** – Remediated files are delivered over an authenticated session, never a public link.
- **Zero Configuration** – No settings screen and no API keys to paste; the plugin registers your site automatically on first use.
- **Integration with All in One Accessibility® Dashboard** – Plans, usage and billing stay in one place.

## Compliance Standards Supported

- WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2

## How It Works

2. **Run AI Remediation** – Select documents and process them in bulk; progress is reported live.
3. **Review & Download** – Inspect each accessibility check with its explanation and before/after example, then download the conformant file.

## CORS Policy Configuration

To avoid CORS policy issues, ensure the following URLs are allowed in your website. These URLs should be added to your CORS configuration or trusted domains list.

| **Domain**                                   | **Description**                     | **Usage**                              |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `https://livepdfapi.skynettechnologies.us`  | AI PDF Remediation API              | Documents, remediation jobs, downloads |
| `https://ada.skynettechnologies.us` | All in One Accessibility® Dashboard | Plan upgrades via autologin            |

## Instructions

1. Update your server's CORS configuration to include these URLs.
2. Ensure wildcard subdomains (`*`) are supported where necessary.
3. Verify the application functionality by testing requests to these domains.
4. If issues persist, consult the documentation for CORS configuration guidance.

### Configuration

- There is no settings screen. Everything the plugin needs is derived from your site, so it works the moment it is
  installed. Open **AI PDF Accessibility Remediation** from the main menu to
  start using it.
